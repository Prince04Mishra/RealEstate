          available on the websites of lending institutions. It allows you to

          to calculate your affordability. It analyses the information entered
          by you and tells you the following things:
          <li className="my-1">The loan amount you will be eligible to get.</li>
          <li className="my-1"> Property cost that you can afford.</li>

            information from the comfort of your home by using online

          Factors that Affect Home Loan Affordability
          <p className="border border-b-gray-200 my-2"></p>
        </h2>
        <span className="font-light text-ba font-serif leading-8 tracking-wide">
          There is a specific reason why affordability calculators ask for
          information related to your finances. It is simply because all those
          things impact your affordability.
          <li className="my-1">
            <span className="font-semibold">Your monthly income:</span> If you
            have a higher monthly income, then your affordability will be high.
            This is because a higher income would indicate a higher ability to
            repay the loan every month.
          </li>
          <li className="my-1">
            <span className="font-semibold">Down payment you can make:</span>{" "}
            Usually, a borrower has to pay 20% of the property cost as the down
            payment. The rest, 80%, is paid by the lending institution. However,
            if you can arrange a higher down payment, you may be eligible for a
            higher loan amount. It will also positively impact your
            affordability.
          </li>
          <li className="my-1">
            <span className="font-semibold">Existing EMIs:</span> If you have
            any existing EMIs, it will reduce your affordability. It is because
            existing EMIs reduce your ability to repay the home loan every
            month.
          </li>
          <p className="my-2 font-mono font-semibold">
            In addition to these factors, certain other factors also affect an
            individual’s affordability. The calculator does not consider these
            things, but they play a significant role in getting a home loan
            approval. Ultimately they affect your affordability, and therefore,
            it’s important to be aware of them.
          </p>
          <li className="my-1">
            <span className="font-semibold">Your current age:</span>
            Age is a significant factor that affects how much home loan you can
            get. Younger individuals have a higher chance of getting higher home
            loans as they have more number of years in front of them to repay
            that loan. The situation is reversed for older people. Just like
            home loan eligibility, age affects affordability as well. If you are
            young and financially stable, then you will have higher
            affordability than someone older.
          </li>
          <li className="my-1">
            <span className="font-semibold">CIBIL score:</span> Every lending
            institution considers your CIBIL score before granting you a home
            loan. A low score may even lead to your loan application getting
            rejected. Therefore, it can be said that a higher CIBIL score is
            directly proportional to your affordability. A higher CIBIL score
            will result in higher affordability. calculators.
          </li>
          <li className="my-1">
            <span className="font-semibold">Availability of collateral:</span>
            Offering collateral always increases the chances of getting a home
            loan because lenders see it as a safe investment. In fact, if you
            have a low CIBIL score but you are able to offer collateral, you may
            increase your chance of getting a loan. Therefore, the availability
            of collateral increases your affordability.
